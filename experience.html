    Research-oriented industry and internship experience are shaping my approach to AI,

  <h2>R&D Consultant — Software & AI Systems</h2>
  <p class="meta">Leyton· Oct-2024 – Present</p>

  <p>
    In my current role as an R&D Consultant, I work at the intersection of
    <strong>software engineering, applied AI, and research-style technical analysis</strong>.
    My responsibilities focus on analysing complex technical systems, identifying genuine
    technological challenges, and articulating why proposed solutions are not readily deducible
    using existing methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    This role requires structured reasoning similar to academic research: formalising problems,
    evaluating competing technical approaches, and communicating uncertainty, assumptions,
    and methodological limitations with precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this work, I developed strong habits around <strong>rigorous claims</strong>,
    <strong>clear justification</strong>, and <strong>evidence-based conclusions</strong>,
    which directly support my preparation for PhD-level research.

  <h2>Industry-Embedded AI Research Intern — Master’s Thesis</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Nokia Solutions & Networks · Network Infrastructure · Mar – Sept 2024
  </p>

  <p>
    This internship corresponded to my <strong>Master’s thesis</strong> and was conducted
    within the Network Infrastructure department at Nokia.
    The work focused on applied <strong>machine learning and deep learning</strong> for
    industrial image classification in real deployment contexts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The research addressed practical constraints such as <strong>class imbalance</strong>,
    <strong>limited labelled data</strong>, and <strong>computational cost</strong>, requiring
    careful model selection and evaluation rather than reliance on benchmark performance alone.
    I explored and compared multiple architectures and ensemble strategies to assess their
    robustness under these conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This experience strengthened my understanding of how AI systems behave outside controlled laboratory settings, and reinforced the importance of <strong>rigorous evaluation</strong>,
    <strong>explicit assumptions</strong>, and <strong>realistic performance expectations</strong>
    when deploying machine learning models in industrial environments.

  <h3>Software Engineering Intern — Information Systems</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    MCA-Morocco (Millennium Challenge Account) · Final Year Internship · Apr–Jun 2022
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of my final undergraduate internship, I designed and implemented a
    <strong>web-based information system</strong> to manage meeting room reservations
    within a public institution operating under strict organisational and operational constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project required translating loosely defined administrative needs into a
    <strong>formal system specification</strong>, followed by architectural design,
    technology selection, and full implementation.
    Beyond development, emphasis was placed on
    <strong>system coherence, maintainability, and correctness</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Conducted requirements analysis and functional decomposition</li>
    <li>Designed UML models (use-case and sequence diagrams) to formalise system behaviour</li>
    <li>Evaluated and selected technologies based on feasibility, scalability, and maintainability</li>
    <li>Implemented a full-stack web application using PHP (Laravel), MySQL, and MVC principles</li>
    <li>Integrated an interactive scheduling component using FullCalendar</li>
    <li>Performed testing and produced structured technical documentation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This experience strengthened my understanding of
    <strong>how real-world systems differ from theoretical designs</strong>,
    particularly in terms of data integrity, user constraints, and long-term system evolution.
    It also laid the groundwork for my later focus on rigorous evaluation,
    system reliability, and evidence-based reasoning in more advanced AI-driven projects.

  <h3>Business Intelligence & Data Engineering Intern</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    ANDZOA — National Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Zones · Mar – Jun 2021
  </p>

  <p>
    During my final undergraduate internship, I worked on the design and implementation of
    a <strong>decision-support system</strong> to help a public agency analyse and monitor
    large-scale development strategies across regions and sectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core challenge was transforming heterogeneous, incomplete Excel-based data into
    a coherent analytical system capable of supporting strategic decision-making.
    This required careful <strong>data modeling, validation, and methodological choices</strong>,
    rather than simple dashboard construction.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Designed a dimensional data warehouse using a star schema (Kimball approach)</li>
    <li>Built ETL pipelines for data cleaning, transformation, and historical tracking</li>
    <li>Defined analytical indicators aligned with policy objectives (region, sector, funding source)</li>
    <li>Developed interactive analytical reports using Power BI</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This experience grounded my interest in <strong>data reliability, evaluation, and the limits
    of real-world data</strong>, and shaped my later focus on rigorous analysis and uncertainty-aware
    reasoning in AI systems.

  <h3>Software Development Intern (Initiation Internship)</h3>
  <p class="meta">3GCOM · Rabat · Jul 2020</p>

  <p>
    During my initiation internship at 3GCOM, I strengthened my programming foundations
    through applied work in <strong>object-oriented software development</strong> using Java.
    The internship focused on building core engineering habits: modelling, implementing,
    and validating program behaviour in a structured way.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Implemented Java OOP concepts: constructors, accessors/mutators, and method design</li>
    <li>Used <code>this</code> to manage object state and method context</li>
    <li>Applied inheritance and polymorphism via an extended class design (e.g., City → Capital)</li>
    <li>Produced a Merise-based conceptual data model (MCD) as part of the design phase</li>
    <li>Tested program behaviour through iterative runs and incremental modifications</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This experience provided an early grounding in clean implementation, abstraction, and
    reasoning about program structure—skills that later supported my progression into
    data/AI and more research-oriented technical work.
