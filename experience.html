  <h2>R&D Consultant — Software & AI Systems</h2>
  <p class="meta">Leyton · Oct-2024 – Present</p>

  <p>
    In my current role as an R&D Consultant, I work at the intersection of
    <strong>software engineering, applied AI, and research-style technical analysis</strong>.
    My responsibilities focus on analysing complex technical systems, identifying genuine
    technological challenges, and articulating why proposed solutions are not readily deducible
    using existing methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    This role requires structured reasoning similar to academic research: formalising problems,
    evaluating competing technical approaches, and communicating uncertainty, assumptions,
    and methodological limitations with precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this work, I developed strong habits around <strong>rigorous claims</strong>,
    <strong>clear justification</strong>, and <strong>evidence-based conclusions</strong>,
    which directly support my preparation for PhD-level research.

  <h2>AI & Machine Learning Intern — Network Infrastructure</h2>
  <p class="meta">Nokia Solutions & Networks · 2024</p>

  <p>
    During my final-year internship at Nokia, I worked within the Network Infrastructure
    department on AI and machine learning applications for digital deployment contexts.
    The work involved analysing technical constraints and applying machine learning techniques
    in environments where data availability, system complexity, and operational requirements
    imposed strict limitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This experience strengthened my understanding of how AI models behave outside controlled
    laboratory settings, and reinforced the importance of evaluation, robustness, and realistic
    performance expectations when deploying ML systems in industrial contexts.

  <h3>Business Intelligence & Data Engineering Intern</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    ANDZOA — National Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Zones · 2020–2021
  </p>

  <p>
    During my final undergraduate internship, I worked on the design and implementation of
    a <strong>decision-support system</strong> to help a public agency analyse and monitor
    large-scale development strategies across regions and sectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core challenge was transforming heterogeneous, incomplete Excel-based data into
    a coherent analytical system capable of supporting strategic decision-making.
    This required careful <strong>data modeling, validation, and methodological choices</strong>,
    rather than simple dashboard construction.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Designed a dimensional data warehouse using a star schema (Kimball approach)</li>
    <li>Built ETL pipelines for data cleaning, transformation, and historical tracking</li>
    <li>Defined analytical indicators aligned with policy objectives (region, sector, funding source)</li>
    <li>Developed interactive analytical reports using Power BI</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This experience grounded my interest in <strong>data reliability, evaluation, and the limits
    of real-world data</strong>, and shaped my later focus on rigorous analysis and uncertainty-aware
    reasoning in AI systems.

  <h2>Software & Systems Intern</h2>
  <p class="meta">MCA-Morocco · DPS-Andzoa</p>

  <p>
    During earlier internships, I gained hands-on experience in software development,
    system design, and data handling in operational environments.
    These roles exposed me to real-world constraints such as incomplete specifications,
    evolving requirements, and integration across heterogeneous systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase of my training helped bridge the gap between theoretical computing concepts
    and applied system design, shaping my pragmatic approach to technical problem-solving.

  <h2>Technical Internship — Software Development Foundations</h2>
  <p class="meta">3GCOM · Early Undergraduate Internship</p>

  <p>
    My early technical internship focused on foundational object-oriented programming,
    system modelling, and software implementation.
    Through this experience, I developed a solid understanding of programming structure,
    abstraction, and the relationship between conceptual models and executable code.
  </p>

  <p>
    This stage laid the groundwork for my later progression into data science,
    artificial intelligence, and research-oriented technical work.
