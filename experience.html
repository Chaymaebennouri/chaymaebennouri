  <h2>R&D Consultant — Software & AI Systems</h2>
  <p class="meta">Leyton · 2022 – Present</p>

  <p>
    In my current role as an R&D Consultant, I work at the intersection of
    <strong>software engineering, applied AI, and research-style technical analysis</strong>.
    My responsibilities focus on analysing complex technical systems, identifying genuine
    technological challenges, and articulating why proposed solutions are not readily deducible
    using existing methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    This role requires structured reasoning similar to academic research: formalising problems,
    evaluating competing technical approaches, and communicating uncertainty, assumptions,
    and methodological limitations with precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this work, I developed strong habits around <strong>rigorous claims</strong>,
    <strong>clear justification</strong>, and <strong>evidence-based conclusions</strong>,
    which directly support my preparation for PhD-level research.

  <h2>AI & Machine Learning Intern — Network Infrastructure</h2>
  <p class="meta">Nokia Solutions & Networks · 2024</p>

  <p>
    During my final-year internship at Nokia, I worked within the Network Infrastructure
    department on AI and machine learning applications for digital deployment contexts.
    The work involved analysing technical constraints and applying machine learning techniques
    in environments where data availability, system complexity, and operational requirements
    imposed strict limitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This experience strengthened my understanding of how AI models behave outside controlled
    laboratory settings, and reinforced the importance of evaluation, robustness, and realistic
    performance expectations when deploying ML systems in industrial contexts.

  <h2>Research & Data Analysis Intern — Vision 2030</h2>
  <p class="meta">Participatory Data · Deliberation Analysis</p>

  <p>
    As part of the Vision 2030 initiative, I worked on analysing large-scale participatory
    and deliberation datasets used for policy planning.
    Rather than focusing solely on aggregate outcomes, my contribution centred on
    identifying methodological and structural issues affecting data quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    I participated in the development of structured error categorisation approaches,
    enabling more reliable interpretation of deliberative inputs.
    This work deepened my interest in <strong>evaluation quality</strong>,
    <strong>human input reliability</strong>, and the limits of automated aggregation
    in collective intelligence systems.

  <h2>Software & Systems Intern</h2>
  <p class="meta">MCA-Morocco · DPS-Andzoa</p>

  <p>
    During earlier internships, I gained hands-on experience in software development,
    system design, and data handling in operational environments.
    These roles exposed me to real-world constraints such as incomplete specifications,
    evolving requirements, and integration across heterogeneous systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase of my training helped bridge the gap between theoretical computing concepts
    and applied system design, shaping my pragmatic approach to technical problem-solving.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Technical Internship — Software Development Foundations</h2>
  <p class="meta">3GCOM · Early Undergraduate Internship</p>

  <p>
    My early technical internship focused on foundational object-oriented programming,
    system modelling, and software implementation.
    Through this experience, I developed a solid understanding of programming structure,
    abstraction, and the relationship between conceptual models and executable code.
  </p>

  <p>
    This stage laid the groundwork for my later progression into data science,
    artificial intelligence, and research-oriented technical work.
