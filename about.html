      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I’m a researcher and consultant working at the intersection of collective intelligence,
        cognitive science, and data-driven evaluation. I care about rigorous methods, reproducibility,
        and building systems that help people and organisations make better decisions under uncertainty.

      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, working on research-driven technical projects and
        evaluation-focused work across AI/ML, software systems, and applied analytics. My academic background
        combines <strong>collective intelligence</strong> with hands-on experience in experimental design,
        statistical analysis, and machine learning.

      <h2>Career Story</h2>

      <h3>1) Foundations — First Degree</h3>
      <p>
        I began my journey with a first degree in <strong>software/engineering and data-related foundations</strong>,
        where I built strong skills in programming, data analysis, and problem solving. This period gave me the
        technical base that later supported my research and applied work in AI and decision systems.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Specialisation — Master’s in Collective Intelligence (UM6P)</h3>
      <p>
        I then pursued a <strong>Master’s in Collective Intelligence</strong>, focusing on how individuals and groups
        generate knowledge, update beliefs, and make decisions. Through experimental projects in cognitive science,
        participatory systems analysis, and forecast evaluation, I developed a strong interest in research methodology,
        evaluation design, and the reliability of collective outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Industry-Embedded Research — Master’s Thesis</h3>
      <p>
        My Master’s thesis was conducted in an industry context, where I investigated deep learning approaches for
        industrial image classification and evaluated the impact of model selection and ensemble learning on performance
        under real-world constraints such as class imbalance and limited labelled data.
        <a href="thesis.html">See thesis →</a>
      </p>

      <h3>4) Professional Practice — R&D Consultant</h3>
      <p>
        Today, I work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, applying research thinking to real technical projects.
        My role involves analysing complex technical work, structuring research narratives, and translating engineering
        uncertainty into clear, evidence-based documentation. This position strengthened my ability to communicate
        technical work to mixed audiences while maintaining methodological clarity and precision.

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I’m a researcher and consultant interested in AI systems that operate under real-world uncertainty.
        My work sits at the intersection of <strong>applied machine learning</strong>, <strong>collective intelligence</strong>,
        and <strong>rigorous evaluation</strong>. I’m currently preparing for a PhD in an AI-related field.

      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, where I analyse technically complex work and communicate it with clarity
        and methodological discipline. I am especially interested in how evidence is generated, how uncertainty is handled,
        and how decisions can be made more reliable through better evaluation and system design.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Career Story</h2>

      <h3>Foundations — First Degree</h3>
      <p>
        I started with a strong technical foundation in computing, developing skills in programming, data handling,
        and analytical problem solving. This base shaped how I approach AI: not as “just model training”, but as
        systems that must be evaluated and made robust in real conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Specialisation — MSc in Collective Intelligence (UM6P)</h3>
      <p>
        During my Master’s in <strong>Collective Intelligence</strong>, my focus expanded to how humans and groups generate
        knowledge, update beliefs, and make decisions — and how algorithmic tools can support or distort these processes.
        I worked on experimental cognitive science studies (trust, credibility, belief updating), deliberation-quality analysis,
        and quantitative forecasting evaluation.
      </p>

      <h3>Industry-Embedded AI Research — Master’s Thesis</h3>
      <p>
        My Master’s thesis was conducted in an industry context and focused on deep learning for industrial image classification.
        The work investigated how model selection and ensemble learning can improve performance under constraints such as class
        imbalance, limited labelled data, and computational cost.

      <h3>Professional Practice — R&D Consultant</h3>
      <p>
        I currently work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, which strengthened my ability to translate complex technical work
        into clear, evidence-based narratives. The role sharpened my thinking around uncertainty, evaluation, and how to communicate
        technical reasoning to mixed audiences — skills that directly support PhD-level research practice.
