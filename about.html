      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I’m a researcher and consultant working at the intersection of collective intelligence,
        cognitive science, and data-driven evaluation. I care about rigorous methods, reproducibility,
        and building systems that help people and organisations make better decisions under uncertainty.

      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, working on research-driven technical projects and
        evaluation-focused work across AI/ML, software systems, and applied analytics. My academic background
        combines <strong>collective intelligence</strong> with hands-on experience in experimental design,
        statistical analysis, and machine learning.

      <h2>Career Story</h2>

      <h3>1) Foundations — First Degree</h3>
      <p>
        I began my journey with a first degree in <strong>software/engineering and data-related foundations</strong>,
        where I built strong skills in programming, data analysis, and problem solving. This period gave me the
        technical base that later supported my research and applied work in AI and decision systems.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Specialisation — Master’s in Collective Intelligence (UM6P)</h3>
      <p>
        I then pursued a <strong>Master’s in Collective Intelligence</strong>, focusing on how individuals and groups
        generate knowledge, update beliefs, and make decisions. Through experimental projects in cognitive science,
        participatory systems analysis, and forecast evaluation, I developed a strong interest in research methodology,
        evaluation design, and the reliability of collective outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Industry-Embedded Research — Master’s Thesis</h3>
      <p>
        My Master’s thesis was conducted in an industry context, where I investigated deep learning approaches for
        industrial image classification and evaluated the impact of model selection and ensemble learning on performance
        under real-world constraints such as class imbalance and limited labelled data.

      </p>

      <h3>4) Professional Practice — R&D Consultant</h3>
      <p>
        Today, I work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, applying research thinking to real technical projects.
        My role involves analysing complex technical work, structuring research narratives, and translating engineering
        uncertainty into clear, evidence-based documentation. This position strengthened my ability to communicate
        technical work to mixed audiences while maintaining methodological clarity and precision.
