      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I’m a researcher and consultant working at the intersection of collective intelligence,
        cognitive science, and data-driven evaluation. I care about rigorous methods, reproducibility,
        and building systems that help people and organisations make better decisions under uncertainty.

      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, working on research-driven technical projects and
        evaluation-focused work across AI/ML, software systems, and applied analytics. My academic background
        combines <strong>collective intelligence</strong> with hands-on experience in experimental design,
        statistical analysis, and machine learning.

      <h2>Career Story</h2>

      <h3>1) Foundations — First Degree</h3>
      <p>
        I began my journey with a first degree in <strong>software/engineering and data-related foundations</strong>,
        where I built strong skills in programming, data analysis, and problem solving. This period gave me the
        technical base that later supported my research and applied work in AI and decision systems.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Specialisation — Master’s in Collective Intelligence (UM6P)</h3>
      <p>
        I then pursued a <strong>Master’s in Collective Intelligence</strong>, focusing on how individuals and groups
        generate knowledge, update beliefs, and make decisions. Through experimental projects in cognitive science,
        participatory systems analysis, and forecast evaluation, I developed a strong interest in research methodology,
        evaluation design, and the reliability of collective outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Industry-Embedded Research — Master’s Thesis</h3>
      <p>
        My Master’s thesis was conducted in an industry context, where I investigated deep learning approaches for
        industrial image classification and evaluated the impact of model selection and ensemble learning on performance
        under real-world constraints such as class imbalance and limited labelled data.
        <a href="thesis.html">See thesis →</a>
      </p>

      <h3>4) Professional Practice — R&D Consultant</h3>
      <p>
        Today, I work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, applying research thinking to real technical projects.
        My role involves analysing complex technical work, structuring research narratives, and translating engineering
        uncertainty into clear, evidence-based documentation. This position strengthened my ability to communicate
        technical work to mixed audiences while maintaining methodological clarity and precision.

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I’m a researcher and consultant interested in AI systems that operate under real-world uncertainty.
        My work sits at the intersection of <strong>applied machine learning</strong>, <strong>collective intelligence</strong>,
        and <strong>rigorous evaluation</strong>. I’m currently preparing for a PhD in an AI-related field.

      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, where I analyse technically complex work and communicate it with clarity
        and methodological discipline. I am especially interested in how evidence is generated, how uncertainty is handled,
        and how decisions can be made more reliable through better evaluation and system design.

  <h2>Career Story</h2>

 <h3>Data Science & Decision Support (DUT IDSD)</h3>
  <p>
  I began my academic training with a <strong>Diploma in Decision Support Computing and Data Science (DUT IDSD)</strong>,
  a program explicitly oriented toward data-driven professions. This formation provided a strong grounding in
  algorithmic thinking, programming, data management, and statistical reasoning, alongside core mathematical
  foundations such as linear algebra, probability, and numerical analysis.
</p>
<p>
  The curriculum combined software development with data-centric skills, covering topics such as
  Python for data science, data visualisation, relational and advanced databases, and decision-support systems.
  I was also introduced early to <strong>artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and deep learning</strong>,
  as well as operational research and enhance methods.
</p>
<p>
  Through applied projects and a technical internship, this training emphasised practical data exploitation,
  problem formulation, and communication of results, while fostering methodological rigour and autonomy.
  This first formation laid the foundations for my later specialisation in AI and collective intelligence,
  and motivated my decision to pursue further academic training.
</p>

<h3>Information Systems Engineering and Software (ISIL)</h3>
<p>
  I completed a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Information Systems Engineering and Software (ISIL)</strong>,
  where I acquired solid technical foundations in software development, object-oriented programming,
  system design and modelling, database administration, and distributed applications.
  The program combined theoretical coursework with hands-on projects covering operating systems,
  computer networks, system security, and cloud computing, while also introducing a project
  management methodologies and agile software engineering practices.
</p>
<p>
  This training strengthened my ability to analyse and design complex information systems,
  work with multi-tier and client–server architectures, and adapt software solutions to
  evolving technological environments. It also provided early exposure to emerging domains
  such as <strong>artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems</strong>, preparing me both
  for applied industry work and for further academic study.
</p>

  <h3>MSc in Collective Intelligence (UM6P)</h3>
<p>
  I pursued a <strong>Master’s degree in Collective Intelligence</strong> at the
  <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong>,
  an interdisciplinary program combining artificial intelligence, cognitive science,
  data science, and social systems analysis. The program focuses on how humans, machines,
  and institutions generate knowledge, coordinate decisions, and manage uncertainty at scale.
</p>
<p>
  During the Master’s, I worked on research-driven projects spanning <strong>experimental
  cognitive science</strong> (belief updating, trust, and credibility), <strong>collective
  intelligence systems</strong> (crowd evaluation, participatory platforms), and
  <strong>quantitative evaluation</strong> (forecast aggregation, statistical modelling,
  and error analysis). This training strengthened my interest in evaluation methodology,
  experimental design, and the limits of AI systems when deployed in real world,
  human-centred contexts.
</p>

  <h3>Industry-Embedded AI Research — Master’s Thesis</h3>
  <p>
    My Master’s thesis was conducted in collaboration with <strong>Nokia</strong> and focused on
    <strong>deep learning for industrial image classification</strong>. The research evaluated multiple CNN
    architectures and ensemble learning strategies under real-world constraints such as class imbalance,
    limited labelled data, and computational cost. This work strengthened my interest in AI robustness,
    generalisation, and evaluation beyond benchmark performance.
    <span class="sep">•</span> <a href="thesis.html">See thesis →</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Professional Practice — R&D Consultant</h3>
  <p>
    I currently work as an <strong>R&D Consultant</strong>, where I analyse complex software and AI-driven projects
    and translate technical uncertainty, experimentation, and innovation into structured research narratives.
    This role sharpened my ability to critically assess AI systems, reason about evidence and limitations,
    and communicate technical work clearly — skills that directly support my preparation for PhD-level research
    in AI-related fields.
