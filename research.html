  <h3>Effect of Type of Source on Response Change</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    Cognitive Science Experimental Study (Master’s level)
  </p>

  <p>
    This experimental study investigates how the type of information source
    (expert vs anonymous) influences participants’ response changes, confidence
    levels, and trust. The study focuses on belief updating mechanisms when
    individuals are exposed to explanations attributed to sources with differing
    credibility.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Research question:</strong> How does source type affect response change, confidence, and trust?</li>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Within-subject experimental design using Qualtrics</li>
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Randomization, counterbalancing, confidence and trust scales</li>
    <li><strong>Key variables:</strong> Source type (expert vs anonymous), response accuracy, confidence, trust</li>
    <li><strong>Validity controls:</strong> Block randomization, counterbalancing to reduce order effects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Results indicate higher confidence and greater response change when explanations
    are attributed to expert sources. The study discusses limitations related to
    fatigue, familiarity with questions, and the need for formal statistical testing.

  <h3>Relationship Between Personality Traits and Academic Motivation</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    Cognitive Science / Educational Psychology Quantitative Study
  </p>

  <p>
    This study examines the relationship between the Big Five personality traits
    and academic motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic) among university students
    at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The objective was to identify which
    personality dimensions are statistically associated with higher levels of
    student motivation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Research question:</strong> What is the relationship between Big Five personality traits and academic motivation?</li>
    <li><strong>Sample:</strong> 39 university students (after data cleaning)</li>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Within-group quantitative study using survey instruments</li>
    <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Big Five personality traits (matrix scale), intrinsic/extrinsic motivation (7-point Likert)</li>
    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Normality testing (Shapiro–Wilk), variance testing (Bartlett), ANOVA/Welch tests, logistic regression</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Results indicate that <strong>conscientiousness</strong> is the only personality
    trait significantly associated with academic motivation. Logistic regression
    analysis shows that students with conscientious traits are more than twice as
    likely to be motivated compared to those without these traits.
  </p>

  <p>
    The study discusses limitations related to sample size, convenience sampling,
    and generalisability, and highlights the need for replication on a larger and
    more representative population.

  <h3>CoLabCareers: Crowd-Based Evaluation of Professional Content</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    Collective Intelligence — Crowd Computing Project (Supervised by Prof. Mark Klein)
  </p>

  <p>
    This project investigates how collective intelligence mechanisms can be used to
    improve the quality and fairness of professional content evaluation in early-career
    job markets. The study explores whether peer-based crowd review can reduce bias,
    encourage constructive feedback, and iteratively improve candidate profiles.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Research question:</strong> How can crowd wisdom be leveraged to evaluate and improve professional content fairly and effectively?</li>
    <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Design and implementation of a crowd-based review platform</li>
    <li><strong>Collective intelligence mechanisms:</strong> Multi-voting, Bag of Stars (BoS), anonymised peer review</li>
    <li><strong>Key design principles:</strong> Anonymity, coopetition, iterative improvement</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation criteria:</strong> Reliability, user satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Results indicate that anonymised crowd review reduces perceived bias related to
    personal attributes (name, gender, nationality) and fosters constructive feedback.
    Peer-generated ratings and comments enabled iterative improvement of submitted
    professional content.
  </p>

  <p>
    Identified limitations include reliance on sustained user engagement, administrative
    moderation requirements, and scalability challenges. Future work proposes integrating
    company feedback, incentive mechanisms, and large-scale data analysis to improve
    robustness and long-term sustainability.
