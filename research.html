  <h3>Effect of Type of Source on Response Change</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    Cognitive Science Experimental Study (Master’s level)
  </p>

  <p>
    This experimental study investigates how the type of information source
    (expert vs anonymous) influences participants’ response changes, confidence
    levels, and trust. The study focuses on belief updating mechanisms when
    individuals are exposed to explanations attributed to sources with differing
    credibility.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Research question:</strong> How does source type affect response change, confidence, and trust?</li>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Within-subject experimental design using Qualtrics</li>
    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Randomization, counterbalancing, confidence and trust scales</li>
    <li><strong>Key variables:</strong> Source type (expert vs anonymous), response accuracy, confidence, trust</li>
    <li><strong>Validity controls:</strong> Block randomization, counterbalancing to reduce order effects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Results indicate higher confidence and greater response change when explanations
    are attributed to expert sources. The study discusses limitations related to
    fatigue, familiarity with questions, and the need for formal statistical testing.

  <h3>Relationship Between Personality Traits and Academic Motivation</h3>
  <p class="meta">
    Cognitive Science / Educational Psychology Quantitative Study
  </p>

  <p>
    This study examines the relationship between the Big Five personality traits
    and academic motivation (intrinsic and extrinsic) among university students
    at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The objective was to identify which
    personality dimensions are statistically associated with higher levels of
    student motivation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Research question:</strong> What is the relationship between Big Five personality traits and academic motivation?</li>
    <li><strong>Sample:</strong> 39 university students (after data cleaning)</li>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Within-group quantitative study using survey instruments</li>
    <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Big Five personality traits (matrix scale), intrinsic/extrinsic motivation (7-point Likert)</li>
    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Normality testing (Shapiro–Wilk), variance testing (Bartlett), ANOVA/Welch tests, logistic regression</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Results indicate that <strong>conscientiousness</strong> is the only personality
    trait significantly associated with academic motivation. Logistic regression
    analysis shows that students with conscientious traits are more than twice as
    likely to be motivated compared to those without these traits.
  </p>

  <p>
    The study discusses limitations related to sample size, convenience sampling,
    and generalisability, and highlights the need for replication on a larger and
    more representative population.

        <h3>Industrial Image Classification under Class Imbalance (Ensemble Learning)</h3>
        <p class="meta">Context: Nokia internship industrial ML</p>

        <p><strong>Problem.</strong> Describe the technical gap (e.g., accuracy degradation under imbalance / rare classes / noisy labels).</p>
        <p><strong>Research question.</strong> Example: “Which ensemble strategies improve minority-class recall without sacrificing overall stability?”</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology.</strong> Models compared (e.g., RF/XGBoost/stacking), sampling strategies, calibration, cross-validation design.</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> Metrics (macro-F1, per-class recall, confusion matrix), baselines, robustness checks.</p>
        <p><strong>Findings.</strong> What worked, what didn’t, and why (error analysis).</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Data constraints, labeling uncertainty, distribution drift, compute limitations.</p>
        <p><strong>Future work.</strong> Ideas that could become publishable (domain adaptation, uncertainty estimation, active learning).</p>

        <h3>Collective Intelligence Platform: Feedback Loops for Matching & Profiling</h3>
        <p class="meta">Context: academic project</p>

        <p><strong>Problem.</strong> Define the technical uncertainty: feedback loops can amplify bias and destabilise ranking.</p>
        <p><strong>Research question.</strong> “How can we design a feedback mechanism that improves relevance while preventing runaway reinforcement?”</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology.</strong> Explain the modelling choice (implicit feedback signals, weighting, regularisation, A/B testing plan).</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> Offline metrics + online proxies, sensitivity analysis, bias checks.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Confounding factors, sparse feedback, cold-start.</p>
        <p><strong>Future work.</strong> Counterfactual evaluation, fairness constraints, causal inference.</p>
